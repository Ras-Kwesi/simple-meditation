# Simple Meditation App

## Overview

**Simple Meditation** is a React Native application designed for personal learning and development. The app provides a platform to practice meditation techniques, helping users to relax and improve their mindfulness. This project was built using **Expo** and leverages various libraries and tools to create a seamless user experience across Android, iOS, and web platforms.

## Features

- **Cross-Platform Support**: Runs on Android, iOS, and the web using Expo.
- **React Navigation**: Smooth and intuitive navigation across screens.
- **Audio Integration**: Play meditation tracks using `expo-av`.
- **Customizable UI**: Styled with Tailwind CSS using `nativewind`.
- **Animations**: Enhanced user experience with `react-native-reanimated`.
- **Safe Area Handling**: Ensures proper layout across devices using `react-native-safe-area-context`.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-meditation.git
   cd simple-meditation
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the project:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. **Run on a specific platform:**
   - Android: `npm run android`
   - iOS: `npm run ios`
   - Web: `npm run web`

## Scripts

- `start`: Launches the Expo development server.
- `reset-project`: Resets the project by running a custom script.
- `android`: Starts the app on an Android emulator or device.
- `ios`: Starts the app on an iOS simulator or device.
- `web`: Starts the app in a web browser.
- `test`: Runs tests using Jest.
- `lint`: Runs linter checks to ensure code quality.

## Technologies Used

- **React Native**: Framework for building native apps.
- **Expo**: Toolset for easy development and deployment.
- **TypeScript**: Statically typed JavaScript for better code quality.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Jest**: Testing framework for running unit tests.

## Future Improvements

- **Additional Meditation Tracks**: Expand the library of available meditation sessions.
- **User Authentication**: Implement user accounts and saved sessions.
- **Advanced Animations**: Add more engaging animations using `react-native-reanimated`.

## Learning Outcomes

- Gained hands-on experience with React Native and Expo.
- Learned to integrate and use various libraries like `react-navigation`, `expo-av`, and `tailwindcss`.
- Improved understanding of cross-platform development and mobile app design.

# Expo Generated Read Me

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
